# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I created a GitPod account and I created a workspace for this repository.

I created an AWS account.

## Installing AWS CLI

I installed AWS CLI.

[Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I installed it on GitPod environment so I used instructions for Linux x86.

`curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"`
`unzip awscliv2.zip`
`sudo ./aws/install`
